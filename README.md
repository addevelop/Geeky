# Geeky
Geeky is an e-commerce website. This is a project that was done for my BTS, the code is not optimal but the site is functional from A to Z.

if you want to use this web app:
- you need to install the database how contains the name "geek.sql" and you need to call the database "geeky" preferably on mysql.
- you need to lunch a server to use php. (apache, ...).
- and on finaly if you want to use the admin account, id = admin, password = Admin123! .
